# swimteam_mgt

This was my final project for CIS 3334. This application was created for swim team coaches to manage the athletes on their team. Each swimmer has a profile picture, name, year, etc. Also, each swimmer has an individual list to keep track of their times for each event. 

Github Link to Sprint 3: https://github.com/Cskeim4/swimteam_mgt 

Selected Features: Popup dialog(5 pts), Handle Images(5 pts), and Unique UI/New Widget-Icon Button and Styling(5 pts)

Future Features: In a future version of this project, I plan to include a dropdown menu that gives each individual swim coach the option to choose a swimmer image from a dropdown menu. Also, I would want to include an update button that allows the user to change things on the swimmer profile or times page without deleting the record and entering new information.
